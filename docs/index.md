# Introduction

Welcome to the t2linux wiki!

This wiki contains knowledge about running Linux on Macs with the T2 chip.
A list of those devices can be found [on Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862).

# Notable Resources

In general you can find most of the people involved on the [Linux on T2 Macs (2018+) Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/68MRhQu), making it probably the most helpful and important resource of all.

## Distributions

Different distributions are maintained by different people in their own repositories.

- Ubuntu [https://github.com/marcosfad/mbp-ubuntu](https://github.com/marcosfad/mbp-ubuntu)
- Fedora [https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora](https://github.com/mikeeq/mbp-fedora)
- Arch [https://github.com/aunali1/linux-mbp-arch](https://github.com/aunali1/linux-mbp-arch)
- Manjaro [https://github.com/JPyke3/mbp-manjaro](https://github.com/JPyke3/mbp-manjaro)

## Kernel Modules

Support for hardware is cross distro besides patches to the distribution specific kernel.
The following repos contain kernel modules for said support.

- MacBook Bridge / T2 Linux Driver [https://github.com/t2linux/apple-bce-drv](https://github.com/t2linux/apple-bce-drv)
- Touchbar and Ambient Light [https://github.com/t2linux/apple-ib-drv](https://github.com/t2linux/apple-ib-drv)

## Guides and similar

Note that if you are using one of the distributions listed above you should follow their install guides rather than the ones listed under this section. However they might still be important to gain a better general picture or to help with specific issues.
